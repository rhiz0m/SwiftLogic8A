/**
 DESCRIPTION:
 You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

 As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

 For example(Input --> Output):
 
 10 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
  1 --> [1]

func monkeyCount(_ n: Int) -> [Int] {
    return Array(1...n)
}

print(monkeyCount(5))

//    var monkeyArr: [Int] = []
//
//    for item in 1...n {
//        monkeyArr.append(item)
//    }
